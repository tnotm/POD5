# _POD5_

_Podcasting app built as a HTML5/packaged web app_

## Synopsis

POD5, a packaged web app written in HTML5, will be one application but with multiple use cases.  The first iteration will be a stand alone podcast app delivering one specific podcast or channel line up.  This will allow podcasters or network creators to brand the app and provide to thier listeners.

The second iteration will be POD5 the full featured padcast(catcher not creator) application, that will allow users to listen to any podcast that they wish.

## Motivation

I wanted to create an app for my personal podcast and wanted to share the code line for others to use.  I also wanted a podcast app developed from the ground up as a packaged web app written in HTML5.

Currently developed for Google Chrome, the intention would be that it would be for all web based Operating Systems.

## Installation

The current development platform is Chrome OS or simply Chrome.  If working in the new [_Chrome Dev Editor_](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg/related) the app can be run by right clicking the *index.html* and selecting run.

Instructions for adding the app to Chrome as a packaged app coming soon.
